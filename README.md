# Atomic-Orbital-Drawer
Very short program to plot a Hydrogen 3,2,0 (3d) orbital cross-section and export it as an SVG. 

The attached python code will plot a 3d orbital with 3200 data points. The number of points and the chosen wavefunction contour (~line of constant probability amplitude) can be adjusted straightforwardly. For details on the operation of the program (e.g. to plot a different Hydrogen orbital), see https://jakeskelton.wordpress.com/2021/01/10/plotting-an-atomic-orbital-cross-section/.
